        <strong className="accent">Skin swelling,</strong> most{' '}
        <strong className="accent">commonly affects the extremities</strong> and is the defining feature of HAE in the
        vast majority of patients. Upper extremities are affected more than lower extremities, followed by the face
        (characterized by generalized swelling of facial features), genitals, and, more rarely, the trunk and neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skin edema in HAE is <strong className="accent">nonpitting and nonpruritic</strong>; blisters and compartment
        syndromes may accompany particularly severe cases.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically, only one site is affected at onset, with edema gradually spreading before receding over a period of
        days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Approximately one-third of cutaneous HAE attacks are preceded by erythema marginatum, a nonpruritic, serpiginous
        rash that produces a map-like pattern on the skin. This symptom occurs more frequently in pediatric patients and
        is a <strong className="accent">potential diagnostic hindrance</strong>, as it can be{' '}
        <strong className="accent">mistaken for similar rashes</strong> accompanying childhood viral or bacterial
        illnesses or may be misdiagnosed as urticaria.

          Symptoms can range from mild, intermittent abdominal discomfort to severe pain accompanied by vomiting and/or

        <p>Laryngeal edema is a rare but potentially fatal clinical manifestation of HAE. </p>

        <p>
          While less than 1% of all swelling episodes involve the larynx, approximately half of all patients with HAE
          have a laryngeal attack at some point in their lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong className="accent">Pediatric patients present a particular diagnostic challenge</strong> because
          laryngeal edema may be <strong className="accent">misdiagnosed</strong> as allergic asthma or epiglottitis.
          Further, compared with adults, asphyxiation in children may{' '}
          <strong className="accent">develop more quickly due to their smaller airway diameter.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          An important diagnostic feature is that{' '}
          <strong className="accent">
            standard medications for alleviating acute airway edema are generally ineffective
          </strong>{' '}
          for laryngeal attacks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clinical symptoms of laryngeal edema include <strong className="accent">voice changes</strong> (such as
          hoarseness or deepening of the voice), a feeling of <strong className="accent">tightness</strong> or a lump in
          the throat, and dysphagia. Patients with advanced swelling often have aphonia (loss of voice) and{' '}
          <strong className="accent">fear of asphyxiation</strong> with substantial anxiety. Upper airway obstruction is
          usually caused by laryngeal and glottal edema.
        </p>

        <p>
          The time from <strong className="accent">onset of laryngeal edema to maximal swelling</strong> has been
          reported to range from <strong className="accent">8 to 12 hours</strong> but may be shorter or considerably
          longer.
